# suricata-public | Public NSM rules

I use this repository to keep track of the Suricata rules that are present in public rulesets. All rules that are kept here are kept as-is with the public source. This is just a way for me to organize what is out there and make it easier if there are updates that need to be done. 

Current focus for rule development is [ET Open](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/) and all the rules present in this repository are there.
