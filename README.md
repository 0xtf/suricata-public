# My public Suricata rules 

I use this repository to keep track of the Suricata rules that are present in public rulesets. All rules that are kept here are kept *as-is* with the public source/ruleset. 

This is just a way for me to organize what is out there and make it easier in case I want to update something. 

Current focus for rule development is [ET Open](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/). Signature Identifiers *(SIDs)* are from that ruleset.
