# suricata-public
I use this repository to keep track of the Suricata rules that are present in public rulesets. 

Current focus for rule development is [ET Open](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/) and all the rules present in this repository are available in that ruleset. 

Rules here are kept as-is with the ruleset.
